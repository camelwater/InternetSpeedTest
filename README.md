# InternetSpeedTest
script to test and graph internet speed. I scheduled it as a task to run a couple of times every day so I could monitor my internet speeds (at the time my internet was very inconsistent, so I wanted to see if there were any patterns - maybe on certain parts of the day it would be worse, or on certain days of the week).
